kind: Kustomization

# NOTE: This kustomization is NOT used for the Helm version patch.
# kubectl apply -k requires base resources to patch against, which are not
# present here. Instead, apply the patch directly with:
#
#   kubectl patch deployment argocd-repo-server -n argocd \
#     --patch-file argocd/bootstrap/repo-server-helm-patch.yaml
#
# NOTE: ArgoCD ServiceMonitors are managed by ArgoCD via
# argocd/applications/3-argocd-servicemonitor-app.yaml — not this bootstrap.
