kind: Kustomization

# This Kustomization patches the ArgoCD repo-server Deployment to support
# custom Helm version injection via init container.
#
# Usage: kubectl apply -k argocd/bootstrap/
#
# This assumes ArgoCD is already installed and applies ONLY the patch.
#
# NOTE: ArgoCD ServiceMonitors are managed by ArgoCD via
# argocd/applications/3-argocd-servicemonitor-app.yaml — not this bootstrap.
